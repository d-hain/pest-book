# Me working through the [PEST](https://pest.rs/) book

I'm working on [a custom file format](https://github.com/d-hain/awesome-map-view)
and after discovering PEST I will probably use it for that.

> [!NOTE]
> I did not do the J example as I have no idea about the J language.
> As well as the Calculator example as I have no need for a Pratt parser.

Please check out the [PEST book](https://pest.rs/book/) if you need
a (nicely documented) parser for anything.
